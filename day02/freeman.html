        <p class="red">
            With an authoritative voice and calm demeanor, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most respected
            figures in modern US cinema. Morgan was born on <em>June 1, 1937</em> in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a
            teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended <strong>Los Angeles City College</strong> before
            serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and <a href="http://www.inventastorca.cz">1959</a>. <span style="color: green">His first dramatic arts exposure
            was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical <span class="unseen">Hello, Dolly!</span></span>.
        </p>

        <p class="green">
            Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including <span class="unseen">"Easy Reader"</span>, "Mel Mounds" and "Count Dracula" on the
            Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show The Electric Company (1971). He then moved into feature
            film with another children's adventure, Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow! (1971). Next, there was a small role
            in the thriller Blade (1973); then he played Casca in <span class="seen, good">Julius Caesar (1979)</span> and the title role in <span>Coriolanus (1979)</span>.
            Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas <span>Attica (1980)</span> and Brubaker
            (1980), Eyewitness (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in Death of a Prophet (1981).
            For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in
            their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an <a href="http://oscar.go.com/" target="_blank">Oscar</a> nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Street Smart (1987) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second
            <a href="http://oscar.go.com/" target="_blank">Oscar</a> nomination in the film version of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097239/"
                target="movies">Driving Miss
            Daisy (1989)</a> opposite <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001788/">Jessica Tandy</a>. The same year, Freeman
            teamed up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic Civil War drama <a href="pages/glory.html"
                target="_blank">Glory (1989)</a> about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting
            brigade.
